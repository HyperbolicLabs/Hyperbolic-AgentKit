This action is responsible for importing your keystores into your validator and starting the validator client. When this tool is called import your validator keystores and start the validator client. 

Below is the command to import your keystores and start the validator client:

Prerequisites:
- A Hyperbolic compute instance must be rented and SSH accessible (via `rent_compute` and `ssh_connect`).
- The prysm environment has been set up on the remote server (via `setup_ethereum_node_environment`).
- The Go Ethereum binary has been installed on the remote server (via `install_geth_binary`).
- A valid JWT token has been generated (via `generate_jwt_for_node`).
- A functioning execution client has been started (via `run_full_ethereum_node`).
- Private keystore have been generated, are accessible, are backed up, and are accessible (via `setup_depositor`).

Input parameters:
- keystore_path: The absolute path to the directory containing the validator keystores
- keystore_password: The password that will be used secure the account used for your validator

Important notes:
- Requires an active SSH connection (use ssh_connect first)
- Use 'ssh_status' to check current connection status
- Commands are executed in the connected SSH session
- Returns command output as a string
